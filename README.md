# Data-Analysis-using-Excel

Created a user-friendly dashboard to dig into store data, finding important insights by thoroughly exploring the information. I created this dashboard with MS Excel, making it easy to see essential performance metrics and trends in the store's data. The results of this analysis help us better understand how the store operates, making it easier to make smart decisions that improve its day-to-day tasks and overall performance.
